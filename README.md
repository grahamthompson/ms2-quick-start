# MS2 Quick Start Package

This repo contains a stub for the `ms2-quick-start` package (just the [publisher.json](publisher.json) file). The steps below provide an intro to using the MS2 developer tools to build a semantic model, develop a notebook data story, and publish the package to the MS2 platform for deployment.

## Prerequisites

Prior to starting this guide, you'll need to have an MS2 admin set up an organization for you to use on the MS2 platform. Additionally, you'll need to get the .vsix file that is used to install the MS2 VS Code extension.

The MS2 experience is built around the open-source semantic modeling language [Malloy](https://www.malloydata.dev/). The MS2 developer tools will assist you as you write Malloy code, but it's still helpful to have a basic understanding of the language. The [Malloy documentation](https://docs.malloydata.dev/documentation/) provides a good introduction and serves as a great reference resource.
