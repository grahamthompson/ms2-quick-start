# MS2 Quick Start Environment

This environment contains the `ms2-quick-start` package which provides a step-by-step intro to using the MS2 developer tools and pushing a package to the MS2 platform. The environment comes with a connection to a BigQuery account with several sample datasets that can be used for building packages. The quick start project utilizes the `ecommerce_bq` dataset which contains sample data from an ecommerce platform.
