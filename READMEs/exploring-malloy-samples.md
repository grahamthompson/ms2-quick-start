# Exploring Malloy Samples

> [!WARNING]
> Work in progress. Kyle to add instructions how to explore the samples in the admin portal.

If you switch the project from "ms2-quick-start" to "malloy-samples" and expand the "Packages" entry within the "MS2 Service" section, you'll see a number of example packages that have been loaded into your organization under the "malloy-samples" project. These packages are available for running on the MS2 platform but are not yet locally available.

If you want to make local additions to any of these packages, you can clone the malloy-samples repo and open that folder in the root of the workspace. You can go into the subfolder for any one of these packages and make changes to the model or notebook analyses. If you want to publish a new version for that package, you can update the version number in the publisher.json file and then find the package in the "MS2 Local Packages" section and click "Publish".
