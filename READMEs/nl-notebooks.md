# Natural Language Notebooks (No-Code + AI UX)

> [!WARNING]
> Work in progress. Josh and Kyle to add instructions and more details here.

MS2’s data platform includes an intelligent, notebook-based interface that combines:

- **Natural language prompts**
- A visual, no-code **Malloy Explorer**
- Governed semantic models behind the scenes

This enables fast, confident data exploration—without needing to write SQL or Malloy.
