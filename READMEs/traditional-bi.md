# Traditional BI (SQL Interface)

> [!WARNING]
> Work in progress. Kyle to add instructions once the SQL interface is available.

Soon, you’ll be able to query Malloy models using SQL directly. This enables:

- Semantic consistency in legacy dashboards
- Reduced maintenance and duplication of logic
- A bridge from your existing BI tools into the semantic layer

> ✅ Great for organizations that want governed, trusted definitions in familiar tools.

> TODO: Josh and Kyle to add instructions and more details here.
