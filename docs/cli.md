# Getting Started with the MS2 CLI

The MS2 Command Line Interface (CLI) offers full control over your semantic modeling resources, matching the capabilities of the MS2 Portal. Itâ€™s built for data engineers and DevOps professionals who prefer to automate workflows and integrate directly with scripts and CI/CD pipelines.

## Installation

Before installing the CLI, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

Install the MS2 CLI globally:

```bash
npm i -g ms2pm
```

## Authentication and Project Setup

Log in to your MS2 organization and set the default project:

```bash
ms2pm login demo
ms2pm set-project malloy-samples
```

You must authenticate with an organization before accessing any resources.

## Basic Package Operations

### List Packages in a Project

```bash
ms2pm ls /
```

Example output:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "ecommerce",
    "latestVersion": "1.0.0",
    "description": "Example Transactional data for an eCommerce business"
  },
  {
    "name": "imdb",
    "latestVersion": "1.0.3",
    "description": "IMDb makes data available for download via their website. Used with permission..."
  }
]
```

### List Versions in a Package

```bash
ms2pm ls /imdb
```

Example output:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "1.0.3",
    "createTimestamp": "2025-03-19T14:57:42.743Z"
  }
]
```

### Publish a New Version

Navigate to the local directory containing your package (e.g., `imdb`) and run:

```bash
cd imdb
ms2pm publish
```

Sample output:

```json
{
  "name": "imdb",
  "latestVersion": "1.0.4",
  "description": "IMDb makes data available for download via their website. Used with permission..."
}
```

You can verify the updated versions with:

```bash
ms2pm ls /imdb
```

## Full CLI Reference

The CLI mirrors most MS2 Portal functionality including:

- Managing organizations, projects, packages, and connections
- Listing, publishing, and deleting resources
- Versioning and access control

You can explore all commands using:
