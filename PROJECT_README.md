# MS2 Quick Start Project

*This README is uploaded to the MS2 platform and provides an overview of the project.*

This project contains the `ecommerce` package which can be used for exploring the MS2 developer tools and the MS2 platform features. The project comes with a connection to a BigQuery account with several sample datasets that can be used for building packages (the connection name is `bq_demo`). The `ecommerce` package utilizes the `ecommerce_bq` dataset which contains sample data from an ecommerce platform.
